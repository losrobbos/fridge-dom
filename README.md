# Fridge DOM Demo

A minimal fridge app using JS DOM

Following JS concepts are applied:
- classes to "store" all our data in the frontend (temporary, lost after page refreshes)
- event listeners to hook action buttons to JS functions (to manage our fridge contents)
- using Array forEach to find product with smallest / biggest volume
- using Array reduce to determine capacity / volume of all items
- using Array filter to determine outdated items
- TailwindCSS for quick, minimal prototype styling

(caution: absolute minimal design :D)
